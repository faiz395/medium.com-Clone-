# Medium.com Clone/Social Media Blogging Website

This project is an attempt to clone medium.com and build a blog/social media website where users can follow each other and like the posts, comment on each other's posts, and edit/update their profiles.

In this project, I have used ReactJs with react-redux, react-router, react hook-form, Tailwind CSS, and for the backend I have used Appwrite

Here is the deployed link of the project : https://mediumdotcomclone.netlify.app/
